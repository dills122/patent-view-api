# Contributing Guidelines

This guide will walk you through setting up the env and other tools and tips that can help.

## Env Setup

This is a `Node.js` project so will require an install of `Node v14` or greater to run the project.

For Editors I would recommend VS-Code as having some of the extensions will make things easier.

VS-Code Extensions:
* Prettier Formatter
* Eslint

Optional, but handy
* GitLens
* npm/npm Intellisense

If you want to make formatting easier on yourself you can have prettier set to autoformat when you save by adding the line below you your settings JSON.

```
"editor.formatOnSave": true
```

## Reporting Bugs

At the moment there are not any structured guidelines on reporting bugs, expect to be as descriptive as possible and feel free to label them with appropriate tagging.

## Pull Requests

PR title should be structures in the format like this:

> Documentation: Added Better Description of API

> Feature: Added investor API Support

> Bug: Fix Issue With API Return Type

Ensure to have proper testing along with your proposed feature or you might be requested to circle back to add more.

Other than that have fun and happy coding!
